# Nihongo üáØüáµ

![Swift Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/swift-3.0-orange.svg?style=flat)

Nihongo is API powered Japanese language morphological analysis Swift library for iOS. It helps you quickly tokenize Japanese sentences and understand its anatomy.

![Nihongo deconstructs your Japanese sentences.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/totocaster/Nihongo/master/Docs/sentence_breakdown.png)

**Motivation:** `NSLinguisticTagger` is fantastic, but before it supports Japanese morphological analysis, this is your easiest option for now.

Thanks for checking-out Nihongo!

Nihongo is powered by [Yahoo Japan's morphological analysis][yjma] API. Supporting of more‚Äîonline and offline‚Äîservice would be nice, but this is only option for now.
