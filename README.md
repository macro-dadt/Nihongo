# Nihongo üáØüáµ

![Swift Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/swift-3.0-orange.svg?style=flat)

Nihongo is API powered Japanese language morphological analysis Swift library for iOS. It helps you quickly tokenize Japanese sentences and understand its anatomy.

*Motivation:* `NSLinguisticTagger` is fantastic, but before it supports Japanese morphological analysis, this is your easiest option for now.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is work in progress repo. I'll start accepting PRs as soon as I have this repo all tidy. By that time proper docs will be in place too. 

Thanks for checking-out Nihongo!
